Divine programming
==================

This is a collection of blog posts, code snippets, etc. Stuff that makes life worth living!

I love dynamic programming languages. Certain lanugages, like Lisp, Scheme and Smalltalk, have a touch of divine elegance associated with them. More recent languages such as Lua, Erlang, Python, and Ruby also have a distinctive beauty and dynamism that feels enlightning.
